# Kidney-Disease-Patient-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Models

This study aims to classify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a deep learning approach. The dataset used is the UCI Chronic Kidney Disease dataset, which is a tabular dataset consisting of 400 patient samples with 24 clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, and other medical parameters. The model was developed based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the TensorFlow/Keras framework, and its performance was also compared with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to determine which architecture provides the best results in detecting CKD.
